This repository contains a recruitment task - solution for a Diamond Kata with unit tests. 

During analyze of the problem I found that the diamond is actually a one part which is reflected along the Y axis (without first column) of symmetry and then X (without last row). 
That's why in the solution I used string concatenations with help of StringBuilder and program is doing reflections line by line.
